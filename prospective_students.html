                            <li>We always have openings for truly outstanding PhD students, starting at every year's spring and fall semesters (so no need to inquiry "whether you have PhD openings" by email). Our group is well funded, and research assistantships will be provided to PhD students by default.</li>
                            <li>The primary avenue for us to recruit PhD stduents is through <b style="color:rgb(71, 71, 71)">UT ECE</b> (DICE Track). Dr. Wang is also eligible to advise and regularly recruits students from <b style="color:rgb(71, 71, 71)">UT CS</b> (Member of Graduate Studies Committee), and <b style="color:rgb(71, 71, 71)">Oden Institute CSEM</b> (Affiliated Faculty).</li>

Please attach your CV, and clearly discuss your research interest and experiences. We are usually not very interested in your GPA and standard test scores.</li>
                            <li>Postdocs, and self-funded visitors are welcome to apply, and will be evaluated case by case. We are always open to working with UT undergraduates and master students for projects. Please contact Dr. Wang by <a href="mailto:atlaswang@utexas.edu">email</a> and specify your interest (we prefer if you can share more than pure "interest").</li>

                            <li>Nothing is more important than a true enthusiasm and devotion to research. We do research only because we are really obsessed with and enjoy our research. Our research interests constantly evolve, and we always stay open to be intellectually excited and inspired by new things.</li>
                            <li>Two other important things that we look for: (1) a truly deep understanding of your problem of interest - don’t naively plug and play "hot" tools; (2) a solid background and a true passion for mathematics. Our research heavily leverages matrix analysis, optimization, and statistical learning.</li>

                            <li>We have a very flat management structure with minimal communication overhead (“Talk is cheap. Show me the code/math”). Every student works directly and closely with Dr. Wang. The group also benefits a lot from its highly interactive, intimate, and helpful culture.</li>
                            <li>We provide extraordinarily strong support to students for internship, visiting, collaboration, networking, and scholarship opportunities. Current Ph.D. students in VITA include winners of five prestigious fellowships (IBM, Apple, Adobe, Qualcomm, and Snap), among many other honors. You are welcome to check their rich experiences. </li>
                            <li>Our students are highly popular among top employers, for both internship and full-time opportunities. During Ph.D. time, almost everyone spends considerable time researching with Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Adobe, NVIDIA, and our many other industry partners, for every year. </li>

He is also a faculty member of the UT Computer Science Graduate Studies Committee (GSC) <a href="https://csrankings.org/"> [CSRankings]</a>, and the Oden Institute CSEM program. Meanwhile, in a part-time role, he serves as the Director of AI Research & Technology for <a href="https://picsart.com/">Picsart</a>, developing the next-generation AI-powered tools for visual creative editing. During 2021 - 2022, he held  a visiting researcher position at Amazon Search. From 2017 to 2020, he was an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering, at the Texas A&M University. He received his Ph.D. degree in ECE from UIUC in 2016, advised by Professor Thomas S. Huang; and his B.E. degree in EEIS from USTC in 2012. </p>

                        <p>Prof. Wang has broad research interests spanning from the theory to the application aspects of machine learning (ML). At present, his core research mission is to leverage, understand and expand the role of  <b style="color:rgb(71, 71, 71)">sparsity</b>, from classical optimization to modern neural networks, whose impacts span over many important topics such as efficient training/inference/transfer (especially, of large foundation models), robustness and trustworthiness, learning to optimize (L2O), generative AI, and graph learning. His research is gratefully supported by NSF, DARPA, ARL, ARO, IARPA, DOE, as well as dozens of industry and university grants. He is/was an elected technical committee member of IEEE MLSP and IEEE CI; an associate editor of IEEE TCSVT (receiving the 2020 Best Associate Editor Award); and regularly serves as area chairs, invited speakers, tutorial/workshop organizers, various panelist positions and reviewers.</p>

                        <p>Prof. Wang has received many research awards and scholarships, including an NSF CAREER Award, an ARO Young Investigator Award, an IEEE AI's 10 To Watch Award, an INNS Aharon Katzir Young Investigator Award, an IBM Faculty Research Award, a J. P. Morgan Faculty Research Award, an Amazon Research Award, an Adobe Data Science Research Award, a Meta Reality Labs Research Award, and two Google TensorFlow Model Garden Awards. His team has recently won the Best Paper Award from the inaugural Learning on Graphs (LoG) Conference 2022; and has also won five research competition prizes from CVPR/ICCV/ECCV since 2018. He feels most proud of being surrounded by some of the world's most brilliant students: his current Ph.D. students include winners of five prestigious fellowships (IBM, Apple, Adobe, Qualcomm, and Snap), among many other honors.</p>
